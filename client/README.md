# Supply Chain Asset Tracker
Web clients for different participants of a supply chain to help with asset creation and tracking. The information will be added to a blockchain, where verified users will be able to track the assets.

The web clients will support three supply chain participants:

* Manufacturers
* Shippers
* Corporations/Companies

These clients will be built upon the [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core) platform. More specifically, the [Sawtooth Supply Chain](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain) distributed application.
